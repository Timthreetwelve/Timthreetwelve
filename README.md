#### Hi there 👋 ###

I'm **Tim**, welcome to my little corner of GitHub. I'm glad that you stopped by. 

I'm a retired mainframe system administrator. I did that for 25 years and now I like to build Windows applications for fun. I like to challenge myself to learn something new. 

If I see a need, a problem to solve, or have an idea of how to make something easier, I challenge myself to build an app to satisfy the need or fix the problem. I publish some of the ones that work here on GitHub in hopes that someone might find them useful. 

There are no guarantees that anything you find here will work in your environment. I'll try to offer support where I can. Although there is no promise that I will agree, I will read any requests for enhancements. I'll do that until it's no longer fun or it **feels like a job**.

Be sure to check out the pinned repositories below. 👇🏻
